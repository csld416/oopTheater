- 04/18 I established the connection between the main page and the login/register. To do that, i introduced the `session manager` class, in which there is a 'email' section where the classes of this appication can check on it, and to verify if the users has logged in. If not, then whenever the end user tries to use the functions that requires the user database we redirect to login section.

    oh yeah i also did many other things.....
    this feels good, it is 2:46 am now, and i started to see the light of this project.
