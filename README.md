I established the connection between the main page and the login/register. To do that, i introduced the `session manager` class, in which there is a 'email' section where the classes of this appication can check on it, and to verify if the users has logged in. If not, then whenever the end user tries to use the functions that requires the user database we redirect to login section.

oh yeah i also did many other things.....
this feels good, it is 2:46 am now, and i started to see the light of this project.

## 04/19
I added the Login page and the register page of the admin in this application, and I will update the database table accrodgingly in the recent days.

## 04/21

I added the `dimmed layer` class so as to mimic the visual effect that it dims the current page if the user presses the panel of the `toggle list` in the top bar panel.
